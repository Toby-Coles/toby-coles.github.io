											<h2>Who am i?</h2>
										</header>
										<p>My name is Toby Coles, i am currently a student at Staffordshire University (Stoke-on-trent)
										studying Computer Games Programming (Bsc) honour. I have a passion for computers and music, hopefully
										one day combining both in some form, possibly as a final year independant project. I am looking forward
									to the challenge of creating game engines and delving into the world of game development and onwards.</p>

									<h3> Duck Wars </h3>

									<p class="content">Duck Wars was my final project for the developing computer games and computer games design module. It was an overhead survival shooter with upgradable weapons, pickups and a random length game wich was a challenge to play in the later stages. All models and code and some textures were created for the game by me.</p>

									<h3>3D Modelling</h3>
									<p class ="content"> For my final 3D modelling project in college I aimed to recrate the scene of a sort of safe location in an apocolyptic game world where one might survive a night inside an abandoned M113 millitary APC, making use of PBR textures, all of my own models and lighting.</p>
